# Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + MDX Scaffold

This repository is a ready-to-push scaffold for:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX-powered **Insights** section (content stored in `content/insights/*.mdx`)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:
- Home: http://localhost:3000
- Insights: http://localhost:3000/insights

## Add a new MDX post

Create a file in:

`content/insights/<your-slug>.mdx`

Example frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "My Post"
date: "2026-01-24"
summary: "Short summary"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
published: true
---
```

Then it will appear on `/insights`.

## Notes

- MDX rendering is handled via `next-mdx-remote/rsc` (server components-friendly).
- Post listing and detail pages read files from disk on the server.
